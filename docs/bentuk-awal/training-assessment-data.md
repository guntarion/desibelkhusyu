## THREE-WEEK TRAINING PROGRAM

### Week 1: Setting and Strengthening Intention

**Objective:** Bring full consciousness that every prayer is pure offering to Allah alone, without showing off or negligence.

**Daily Practice:**
- Before prayer, train yourself to intend in heart: "I pray because of Allah Ta'ala"
- Pray before Takbir: "O Allah, improve my intention in this prayer. Make it pure for You"
- **Mindfulness of Intention:** Silent for 5 seconds before Takbir, bring heart presence only for Allah

**Evidence Reference:**
- Hadith: "Indeed, every deed depends on its intention..." (HR. Bukhari no. 1; Muslim no. 1907)
- Ibn Qudamah: "Intention is in the heart, not on the tongue." (Al-Mughni, 1/287)

### Week 2: Understanding Meaning of Prayer Recitations

**Objective:** Realize the meaning of every phrase uttered, so heart and mind prostrate together with tongue.

**Daily Practice:**
- Understand 1-2 new recitation meanings each day: Start from Al-Fatihah, Takbir, Rukuk, Sujud, to Salam
- When reading Al-Fatihah, contemplate its meaning verse by verse
- Use Sujud moments to realize we are in closest position to Allah

**Daily Focus Examples:**
- Day 1: Understand meaning of "Allahu Akbar"
- Day 2: Understand meaning of "Subhana Rabbiyal Adzim"
- Day 3: Understand meaning of "Subhana Rabbiyal A'la"
- Day 4: Understand meaning of Tasyahhud
- etc.

**Evidence Reference:**
- Allah says: "...So pray to your Lord with full Khusyu." (QS. Al-Kautsar: 2)
- Imam Al-Ghazali: "The reality of prayer is not valid without understanding its meaning." (Ihya' Ulumuddin, Book of Prayer Secrets)

### Week 3: Soft Reading and Mindfulness Practice

**Objective:** Read with soft voice to strengthen heart focus, maintain tranquility, and bring Allah's presence in prayer.

**Daily Practice:**
- Practice soft reading in every obligatory and sunnah prayer
- **Focus on breathing and voice:** Feel recitation flowing from chest, not just from mouth
- **Mindfulness when reading:** When saying "Iyyaka na'budu wa iyyaka nasta'in" bring full consciousness: only to Allah we worship and only to Allah we ask for help

**Small Techniques:**
- Close eyes halfway during Sujud to deepen concentration (may be done without forcing)
- Feel that every recitation is direct conversation with Allah

**Evidence Reference:**
- Allah says: "Pray to your Lord with humility and soft voice." (QS. Al-A'raf: 55)
- Ibnul Qayyim: "Reading with soft voice in worship strengthens heart's Khusyu." (Madarijus Salikin, 1/520)

## ACHIEVEMENT LEVEL SYSTEM (5 LEVELS)

### Level 5: Al-Khusyu' al-Kaamil (Perfect Khusyu)
**Requirements:**
- Intention: Straightened with full consciousness as worship
- Understanding meaning: ≥ 75% of all prayer recitations
- Soft reading ability: 100% recitations with 30dB, able to direct hearing sense 75% to listen with full concentration
- Heart presence when reading softly: ≥ 50%

**Description:** "Soul-touching Prayer" - At this level, a person is truly present fully in prayer. Straight intention, understood recitation meaning completely, soft voice heard by oneself, and entire body and heart synchronized in one complete consciousness. Not only physical tranquility, but also inner tranquility. This is the highest condition - may not be easy to achieve, but very possible if practice is done with consistency and full love.

### Level 4: Al-Khusyu' al-Mutawassith (Intermediate Khusyu)
**Requirements:**
- Intention: Correct and conscious
- Understanding meaning: ≥ 50% of prayer recitations
- Soft reading ability: 75% recitations and successfully directing hearing sense 50% to listen with full concentration
- Heart presence when reading softly: achieved minimum 20%

**Description:** "Shaking Prayer" - Prayer at this level has touched most of the heart. Soft voice has become habit, most recitation meanings are understood, and concentration is maintained during most prayer time. Although not yet perfect, prayer already feels different. There are vibrations, hope, and relief felt after Salam.

### Level 3: Al-Hudhur (Soul Presence)
**Requirements:**
- Intention: Correct
- Understanding meaning: ≥ 20% of prayer recitations
- Soft reading ability: 50% recitations and successfully hearing 25% with full concentration
- Heart presence when reading softly: achieved minimum 10%

**Description:** "Prayer Being Trained" - At this level, consciousness begins to grow. A person is aware they are standing before Allah, and begins building involvement through soft voice, understanding practice, and slowing movements. Heart is not yet fully present, but is trying to adjust. This is an important transition phase, from formal prayer to spiritual prayer.

### Level 2: Al-'Adah bil Ghaflah (Habitual in Negligence)
**Requirements:**
- Intention: Correct
- Understanding meaning: Not yet understanding prayer recitation meaning, only fluent because memorized
- Soft reading ability: 25% recitations with soft voice, but cannot focus yet, only hearing around 10%
- Heart presence: Not yet present when reading

**Description:** "Prayer Due to Obligation" - Prayer at this level is still done merely because of obligation. Recitations are said, movements are done, but everything happens quickly and without contemplation. Heart is not yet present, soft voice is not yet used consciously, and recitation meanings are not known. This is common condition of many Muslims - knowing obligation but not yet feeling closeness.

### Level 1: Ash-Sholah ash-Shuriyyah (Merely Formal Prayer)
**Requirements:**
- Intention: Correct
- Understanding meaning: Not yet understanding recitation meaning
- Soft reading ability: 10% recitations with soft voice, but cannot focus hearing yet
- Heart presence: Cannot bring heart presence yet

**Description:** "Prayer Just to Finish" - This is the lowest point of Khusyu. Prayer is done quickly, like mechanical routine. No understanding, no soft voice, no heart presence. Prayer only fulfills obligation, even sometimes not remembering which rak'ah. Although sounds sad, this can be beginning of awakening if realized and wants to be improved.
