## CHAPTER 1: WHY KHUSYU PRAYER IS IMPORTANT

### Definition of Khusyu According to Al-Qur'an and Hadith

#### What is Khusyu?
**Linguistic Definition:** Khusyu comes from the word "khasya'a" (خشع), meaning to submit, be calm, and humble with full submission.

**Islamic Terminology:** Khusyu means submission of heart and body in bringing fear, reverence, and love to Allah during worship, especially in prayer.

**According to Imam Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbali in Fath Al-Bari:**
"Khusyu is the presence of heart before Allah with full submission and respect, so that body parts also become calm and do not perform useless movements."

**Key Point:** Khusyu is not just physical expression (like bowing head) but deeper: submission of heart and mind before Allah.

#### Evidence from Al-Qur'an
**Primary Verse:**
"Surely successful are the believers, those who are humble in their prayers." (QS. Al-Mu'minun: 1-2)

**Tafsir Ibn Kathir Explanation:** What is meant by Khusyu here is calmness of heart and body parts, not looking here and there, and focusing on prayer.

**Warning Verse:**
"Woe to those who pray, (namely) those who are negligent of their prayers." (QS. Al-Ma'un: 4-5)

**Scholars' Interpretation:** What is meant by negligent here is those whose prayers are without heart presence, without Khusyu, even if physically they still perform prayer.

#### Evidence from Prophet's Hadith ﷺ
**Hadith 1:**
"Indeed when a servant prays, then his mind branches out, Allah says: 'To whom is he turning?'" (HR. Ahmad and Al-Hakim, authentic chain according to Al-Albani)

**Meaning:** This hadith emphasizes that heart presence during prayer is part of a servant's etiquette toward Allah.

**Hadith 2:**
"The best prayer of someone is when he is most Khusyu in it." (HR. Ahmad, Abu Dawud)

**Meaning:** This hadith emphasizes that prayer quality is determined by its level of Khusyu, not just length of recitation or number of movements.

**Important:** Khusyu is heart worship that manifests in body behavior.

### Urgency of Khusyu Prayer

#### 1. Khusyu as Key to Success in This World and Hereafter
**Quranic Evidence:**
"Surely successful are the believers, those who are humble in their prayers." (QS. Al-Mu'minun: 1-2)

**Tafsir Al-Qurthubi:** What is meant by "successful" here is succeeding in gaining Allah's pleasure, safety in this world and paradise in the hereafter.

**Key Point:** Without Khusyu, prayer remains valid, but its value and reward are greatly reduced.

#### 2. Prayer Without Khusyu Risks Losing Reward
**Hadith Evidence:**
"Indeed someone finishes his prayer and nothing is written for him except one-tenth, one-ninth, one-eighth, one-seventh, one-sixth, one-fifth, one-fourth, one-third, or half of his prayer." (HR. Abu Dawud, hasan sahih)

**Teaching:** This hadith teaches that prayer quality is assessed based on Khusyu and heart presence. Those who pray but their minds wander, hearts negligent, only get small portion of that prayer's reward.

**Key Point:** The more Khusyu someone is, the more perfect their prayer reward.

#### 3. Khusyu as Main Characteristic of True Believers
**Quranic Evidence:**
Al-Qur'an opens believers' characteristics with prayer Khusyu: "Surely successful are the believers, those who are humble in their prayers." (QS. Al-Mu'minun: 1-2)

**Ibn Kathir's Tafsir:** Ibn Kathir mentions that Allah prioritizes Khusyu trait in prayer as sign of faith perfection.

**Key Point:** The presence or absence of Khusyu in prayer is indicator of someone's faith quality.

#### 4. Khusyu Prayer Prevents Indecent and Evil Acts
**Quranic Evidence:**
"Indeed prayer prevents from indecent and evil acts." (QS. Al-Ankabut: 45)

**Scholar Interpretation:** Scholars like Imam Al-Ghazali in Ihya' Ulumuddin interpret that prayer capable of preventing sins is prayer performed with full Khusyu.

**Key Point:** Khusyu prayer shapes Muslim character to be cleaner, honest, patient, and noble. Conversely, prayer performed without heart presence is difficult to provide behavioral change effect.

#### 5. Khusyu Prayer as Best Provision Toward Death
**Hadith Evidence:**
"Someone will be resurrected (in afterlife) based on their final state." (HR. Muslim)

**Connection:** Khusyu prayer throughout life will shape peaceful soul, which Allah mentions in Al-Qur'an: "O peaceful soul, return to your Lord with satisfied heart and pleasing to Him." (QS. Al-Fajr: 27-28)

**Key Point:** Khusyu prayer trains someone to meet death in best state, namely Khusyu, conscious of Allah, and peaceful.

**Conclusion:** Therefore, struggling for Khusyu prayer is serious obligation of every Muslim.

### Causes of Lack of Khusyu in Prayer

#### 1. Lack of Understanding About Prayer Meaning
Many people perform prayer only as movements and recitations without understanding the meaning of every phrase uttered. Understanding the meaning of prayer recitations and movements can help heart connect more with Allah.

**Imam Ibnul Qayyim's Statement:**
"Khusyu in prayer relies on understanding the meaning of recitations and dhikr uttered." (Madarijus Salikin, 1/521)

#### 2. Negligent and Rushed in Prayer
**Prophet's Hadith ﷺ:**
"The worst thief is one who steals in his prayer." The companions asked: "O Messenger of Allah, how does someone steal in his prayer?" He answered: "He does not perfect his rukuk and sujud." (HR. Ahmad, 5/310; declared hasan by Al-Albani)

**Meaning:** Rushed prayer shows lack of heart attention to that prayer.

#### 3. Many Temptations and Whisperings (Waswas)
Satan tries hard to disturb a servant's Khusyu. Rasulullah ﷺ said: "Satan named Khanzab comes to someone in his prayer then whispers: 'Remember this and that,' so he doesn't know how many rak'ahs he has performed." (HR. Bukhari no. 1231 and Muslim no. 389)

**Impact:** Unnecessary thought disturbances greatly affect concentration and heart presence in prayer.

#### 4. Excessive Love of This World
Heart dependence on this world makes prayer feel heavy and burdened. Allah says: "And do not incline toward those who are unjust, lest you be touched by the fire." (QS. Hud: 113)

**Effect:** Love of this world fills the heart, so there is no more room to bring Khusyu to Allah in prayer.

#### 5. Unsupportive Environment
Noisy atmosphere, disturbing clothes, or unclean prayer place can cause disturbed Khusyu. Prophet ﷺ reprimanded companion who wore flashy patterned clothes during prayer: "Wear your plain clothes because those clothes better help Khusyu in prayer." (HR. Abu Dawud, no. 652; hasan hadith)

## CHAPTER 2: PREPARATION BEFORE STARTING PRAYER

### Perfecting Wudu with Consciousness

#### Meaning of Perfecting Wudu
Perfecting wudu means:
- Washing all wudu parts perfectly without any part left out
- Performing wudu according to Prophet ﷺ's guidance (wudu sunnahs like washing parts three times, prioritizing right side, praying after wudu)
- Performing wudu with heart consciousness, not just routine

**Prophet Muhammad ﷺ's Saying:**
"Perfect your wudu, woe to heels from hellfire." (HR. Bukhari no. 60 and Muslim no. 241)

**Meaning:** This hadith shows importance of perfecting washing, because even slight negligence can have big impact.

#### Consciousness in Wudu
Consciousness during wudu includes:
- Correct intention, namely performing wudu because of Allah and to perform worship
- Bringing heart presence, realizing that every drop of water erases sins
- Tadabbur (contemplating) wudu's greatness as form of outer and inner cleansing

**Rasulullah ﷺ's Saying:**
"When a servant performs wudu then rinses mouth, sins come out from his mouth; when he inhales water into nose then expels it, sins come out from his nose; when he washes his face, sins come out from his face, until they come out from under his eyelashes; when he washes both hands, sins come out from his hands; when he wipes his head, sins come out from his head; and when he washes both feet, sins come out from both feet, until they come out from under his nails." (HR. Muslim no. 244)

**Teaching:** This hadith shows that wudu is means of cleansing oneself from minor sins, provided it's done with consciousness and sincerity.

#### Benefits of Perfecting Wudu
Many benefits Allah gives to those who perfect wudu with consciousness:
- Sins forgiven
- Degrees elevated in Allah's sight
- Given light on wudu parts on Judgment Day

**Prophet ﷺ's Saying:**
"My ummah will be called on Judgment Day in state of glowing faces, hands, and feet due to wudu traces. Whoever among you can extend that light, let him do so." (HR. Bukhari no. 136 and Muslim no. 246)

#### Some Sunnahs to Perfect Wudu
- Say Bismillah before wudu
- Use Siwak (brush teeth) before wudu
- Wash wudu parts three times
- Prioritize right side
- Read prayer after wudu: "Asyhadu an laa ilaaha illallaahu wahdahu laa syariikalahu, wa asyhadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhu wa rasuuluh." (HR. Muslim no. 234)

Additional prayer: "Allahumma ij'alnii minat-tawwaabiin, waj'alnii minal-mutathohhiriin." (O Allah, make me among those who repent and those who purify themselves)

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Rushing in wudu without paying attention to parts that must be washed
- Not ensuring water reaches between fingers and toes
- Not wiping entire head
- Taking lightly intention and etiquette in wudu

### Preparing Proper Clothing and Place

#### Importance of Preparing Proper Clothing
Proper clothing for prayer meets several requirements:
- Pure from najis (both minor and major)
- Covering awrah completely (Men: minimum from navel to knees; Women: entire body except face and palms)
- Not transparent or thin
- Not tight showing body curves
- Neat and clean, as form of respect to Allah

**Rasulullah ﷺ's Saying:**
"Indeed Allah is beautiful and loves beauty." (HR. Muslim no. 91)

**Therefore:** Dressing neatly and cleanly during prayer is part of honoring Allah's command.

**Special Note:**
- Prayer clothing doesn't have to be expensive or luxurious, but must be clean, pure, and proper
- Not allowed to pray with clothing contaminated by najis, like urine splashes, blood, or dirt

#### Preparing Proper Prayer Place
**Prayer place requirements:**
- Pure from najis
- Peaceful, not disturbing Khusyu
- Facing Qibla
- No statues or distracting images

**Prophet Muhammad ﷺ's Saying:**
"The entire earth is made for me as mosque and purification tool. So wherever someone from my ummah finds prayer time, let him pray." (HR. Bukhari no. 335 and Muslim no. 521)

**However:** Although earth is made prayer place, that place must be pure from najis. Prophet ﷺ also forbade praying in inappropriate places like garbage dumps, animal stables, or graves.

**Prayer Place Etiquette:**
- Clean place before prayer if there is dirt
- Use clean prayer mat or base
- Avoid crowded and noisy places if possible

#### Why Must Prepare Well?
Because:
- Honoring Allah's command
- Helping achieve Khusyu in worship
- Showing serious attitude and full etiquette in worship
- As form of tazkiyah (self-purification) outwardly and inwardly

**Allah's Word:**
"Indeed successful is one who purifies himself (with faith and righteous deeds), and remembers his Lord's name then prays." (QS. Al-A'la: 14-15)

### Preparing Heart Before Prayer

#### What is Meant by Preparing Heart?
Preparing heart means:
- Cleansing heart from worldly concerns when about to pray
- Realizing that we will face Allah, King of all kings
- Bringing sense of need, submission, and humility before Him
- Strengthening intention that this prayer is for Allah alone, not empty routine

**Prophet Muhammad ﷺ's Saying:**
"Indeed in the body there is a piece of flesh; if it is good, then the whole body is good, and if it is corrupted, then the whole body is corrupted. Know that it is the heart." (HR. Bukhari no. 52 and Muslim no. 1599)

#### Ways to Prepare Heart Before Prayer

**a) Perfect Wudu**
Performing wudu with full consciousness helps heart become calm.

**b) Temporarily Leave Worldly Affairs**
When prayer time approaches, leave worldly matters and prepare to focus.

**c) Bring Fear and Hope**
Remember that we are standing before the Almighty.

**d) Remember Death and Hereafter**
Imagine as if this is our last prayer.

**e) Pray Before Takbir**
Pray in heart to be given Khusyu, for example: "O Allah, distance me from Satan's temptation and busy my heart only for You in this prayer."

## THE THREE-STEP METHOD: 30 DESIBEL PLUS

### Overview of the Method
The 30 Decibel Plus Method consists of three main steps:
1. **Setting Proper Intention** - Conscious awareness of worshipping Allah alone
2. **Understanding Prayer Recitations** - Converting memorized texts into meaningful dialogue  
3. **Soft Voice Reading + Mindfulness** - Reading at ~30dB with full consciousness

### Technical Process (The "Plus" Component)
The technical process involves 5 synchronized steps:

1. **Reading recitations with soft voice (±30 decibels)** - Like whispering, audible to oneself
2. **Active listening (brain command to ears)** - Consciously directing hearing to focus on the soft voice
3. **Brain synchronization: sound, meaning, and awareness** - Connecting what is heard with understood meaning
4. **Sending message from brain to heart** - Transferring cognitive understanding to emotional/spiritual center
5. **Synchronizing movements and recitations** - Aligning physical actions with meaningful recitations

### Why This Method Works
- **Creates Virtual Space:** Soft voice creates intimate dialogue space with Allah
- **Engages Multiple Senses:** Combines voice, hearing, understanding, and feeling
- **Prevents Mind Wandering:** Active listening keeps focus on prayer
- **Builds Habit:** Consistent practice makes Khusyu natural, not forced
- **Scientifically Sound:** Uses known principles of mindfulness and focused attention

### Decibel Reference for Understanding
- 20-30 dB: Very soft whisper
- 30-40 dB: Soft voice, clearly audible to oneself
- 50-60 dB: Normal speech, audible to others nearby
- 80-90 dB: Loud voice (busy street)

**Target for Prayer:** 30-40 dB - soft enough to maintain tranquility, clear enough for active listening.
