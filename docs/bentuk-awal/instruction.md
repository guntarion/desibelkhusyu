I need to create an app from a book "Tiga Langkah Mudah menuju Sholat Khusyu' dengan metode 30 desibel plus", oleh Iwan Efrulwan Muhajirin.

Help me implement the plan.

You must use desktop commander MCP to read, write, edit on my local computer instead of creating artifact in this chat.

Study the plan at /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/al_muhajirin_rewwin/desibelkhusyu/docs/bentuk-awal/plan-by-claude.md

Use the resource at /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/al_muhajirin_rewwin/desibelkhusyu/docs/bentuk-awal/training-assessment-data.md

Write and continuously update your progress at /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/al_muhajirin_rewwin/desibelkhusyu/docs/bentuk-awal/progress.md

Important:

- The app interface as well the content should be in BAHASA INDONESIA
- it is optimized for mobile.

After you done implementing, please create documentation at /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/al_muhajirin_rewwin/desibelkhusyu/README.md - make single source of truth for this project - describe all information needed for a developer to understand what needs to keep in mind before begin making any further implementation. 



Pelajari dan lakukan analisa pada dokumen terlampir, buku "Tiga Langkah Mudah menuju Sholat Khusyu' dengan metode 30 desibel plus", oleh Iwan Efrulwan Muhajirin 

 Saya bermaksud membuat aplikasi next.js tentang ini, di /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/al_muhajirin_rewwin/desibelkhusyu



I have formulated plan with help of gemini at /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/al_muhajirin_rewwin/desibelkhusyu/docs/bentuk-awal/plan-by-gemini.md - You must review and improve this plan your own.

Write your plan at /Users/guntar/Documents/SourceCodes/PROJECTS/al_muhajirin_rewwin/desibelkhusyu/docs/bentuk-awal/plan-by-claude.md

All the content you need to write/show at the app, please take it from the attached PDF. All of it. Since I want to code not in this chat, but in a new chat. So make sure your written plan can be comprehend by another chat. Basically, just write out all we need to begin implementation. In the new chat, I will not attach the .pdf again.

After you done creating plan, STOP. I need to review your plan.
